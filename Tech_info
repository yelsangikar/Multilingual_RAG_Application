unstructured:

            If it's a text-based PDF:
            It extracts raw text directly from the document

            It uses pdfminer.six under the hood

            Detects paragraphs, titles, tables, etc.

            If it's an image-based PDF or PNG/JPEG:
            It can't read text directly ‚Äî it's just pixels

            So unstructured uses:

            pdf2image: to convert PDF pages to images

            pytesseract: to run OCR on each image and extract text


pytesseract(Optical Character Recognition):

            Tesseract is a trained model that:

            Detects characters in images

            Matches them to known patterns for each language

            Supports 100+ languages (if language packs are installed)

            For example:

            eng for English

            jpn for Japanese

            chi_sim for Simplified Chinese

            done by these: UnstructuredPDFLoader, UnstructuredImageLoader

unstructured_inference

            üß† Purpose: ML-based inference engine used by the unstructured library
            This is a backend used by the unstructured library for document layout parsing, text classification, and partitioning.

            It contains ML models for identifying things like:

            Headings

            Titles

            Lists

            Tables

            Section breaks

            Often used when calling unstructured.partition.auto or partition_pdf() etc.

üß† 1. YOLOX

            YOLOX is an advanced object detection model from Megvii.

            It is an improvement over earlier YOLO versions (like YOLOv4 and YOLOv5), using anchor-free architecture and decoupled heads.

            L usually stands for "Large" variant (YOLOX comes in sizes: nano, tiny, s, m, l, x).


üß© Breakdown of Time
1. Text Extraction via PyMuPDFLoader (‚úÖ Fast)
Extracts all page texts in one go

        Time: 1‚Äì5 seconds even for 200 pages

        Depends on:

        PDF size (MB)

        Text vs image content

        Your CPU/RAM

        ‚û°Ô∏è Fast and efficient ‚Äî no real concern here.

2. Image Extraction + GPT-4 Vision Calls (üê¢ Slowest Part)

        If each page has even 1 image:

        Extracting the image: ~0.1s per image (fair)

        Sending it to gpt-4o vision: 3‚Äì10 seconds per image, depending on:

        Image size (larger = slower)

        API latency

        Internet speed

        Your OpenAI rate limits

        üìâ This is the bottleneck
