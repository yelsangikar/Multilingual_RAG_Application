unstructured:

            If it's a text-based PDF:
            It extracts raw text directly from the document

            It uses pdfminer.six under the hood

            Detects paragraphs, titles, tables, etc.

            If it's an image-based PDF or PNG/JPEG:
            It can't read text directly â€” it's just pixels

            So unstructured uses:

            pdf2image: to convert PDF pages to images

            pytesseract: to run OCR on each image and extract text


pytesseract(Optical Character Recognition):

            Tesseract is a trained model that:

            Detects characters in images

            Matches them to known patterns for each language

            Supports 100+ languages (if language packs are installed)

            For example:

            eng for English

            jpn for Japanese

            chi_sim for Simplified Chinese
